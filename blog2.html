    <h1>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: What Each One Actually Does</h1>
    <img src="assets/Front-end web development diagram.png" alt="error">
    <p>When I started web development, I treated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript like one big subject. That made learning
        harder than it needed to be. Everything changed once I understood their individual roles. <br><br>
        HTML is responsible for structure and content. It tells the browser what elements exist on the page—headings,
        paragraphs, buttons, images, and forms. Without HTML, there is no website. <br>
        CSS handles design and layout. It controls colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, and responsiveness. CSS is what
        makes a website visually attractive and user-friendly. <br>
        JavaScript adds behavior and logic. It allows websites to react to user actions, fetch data from APIs, show
        popups, validate forms, and update content dynamically. <br>
        Think of a website like a human body: <br>
        <strong>HTML = skeleton <br>
            CSS = appearance <br>
            JavaScript = brain <br> </strong>
        Once I understood this separation, learning became less overwhelming. Instead of trying to master everything at
        once, I focused on improving one layer at a time.
