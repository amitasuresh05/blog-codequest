    <h1>How I Stay Consistent While Learning to Code</h1>
    <img src="assets/ChatGPT Image Feb 1, 2026, 02_13_17 PM.png" alt="error">
    <p>One of the hardest parts of learning to code isn’t understanding concepts—it’s staying consistent. There were
        days I felt motivated and days I didn’t want to open my laptop at all. <br><br>
        At first, I tried studying for long hours, which quickly led to burnout. Later, I switched to shorter, focused
        sessions. Even 30 minutes a day made a big difference.
        I also stopped comparing myself to others. Seeing people build amazing projects used to discourage me. Instead,
        I started comparing myself to my past progress.
        Another thing that helped was building small projects. Completing something—even tiny—gave me confidence and
        motivation to continue. <br>
        <strong>Consistency isn’t about being perfect.
            It’s about showing up, even on days when you don’t feel like it.</strong><br>
        If you keep going one step at a time, progress will come.
