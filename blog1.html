    <h1>How I Built My First Web App (And What Broke Along the Way)</h1>
    <img src="assets/Developer troubleshooting errors at workspace.png" alt="error">
    <p>Building my first web application was one of the most exciting moments of my learning journey. I finally felt
        like I was doing something “real.” But that excitement didn’t last very long—because things started breaking
        almost immediately.
        I began with a simple idea using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML helped me create the structure, and CSS made
        everything look decent. But once I added JavaScript for interaction, nothing behaved the way I expected.

        Buttons didn’t respond. Inputs didn’t work. Sometimes the page would load completely blank. At first, I felt
        frustrated and thought maybe I wasn’t good enough for coding. Then I realized the problem wasn’t me—it was part
        of the learning process.
        I slowly learned how to debug using browser developer tools. I started reading error messages instead of
        ignoring them. I used console.log() everywhere just to understand what my code was doing. Small fixes started
        giving me big confidence.
        This experience taught me an important lesson: <br>
        <strong>Every bug is a hidden teacher.</strong><br>
        If you’re building your first project and everything feels broken—good. That means you’re actually learning.
