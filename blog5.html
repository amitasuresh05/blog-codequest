    <h1>5 Small Projects Every Beginner Developer Should Try</h1>
    <img src="assets/ChatGPT Image Feb 1, 2026, 02_14_41 PM.png" alt="error">
    <p>Starting out as a developer can feel overwhelming. Tutorials teach concepts, but real learning happens when you
        build something yourself. The trick is to pick small projects that are achievable yet challenging enough to push
        your skills. <br>
        Here are 5 beginner-friendly projects I recommend: <br><br> <strong>1. To-Do List App </strong><br>
        This project teaches HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for adding, deleting, and marking tasks
        as complete. It’s simple, but you’ll learn about DOM manipulation and local storage. <br> <br>

        <strong>2. Calculator</strong><br>
        A basic calculator is an excellent way to practice JavaScript logic. You’ll handle numbers, operators, and edge
        cases, all while improving your problem-solving skills. <br>  <br>

        <strong>3. Weather App</strong><br>
        Using a weather API, you can create an app that shows live weather data. This project teaches fetching external
        data, handling JSON, and updating the UI dynamically. <br> <br>

        <strong>4. Quiz App</strong><br>
        Create a simple multiple-choice quiz. This helps with dynamic content, loops, arrays, and basic scoring logic.
        You can even add animations for correct/wrong answers. <br> <br>

        <strong>5. Portfolio Website</strong><br>
        A personal portfolio is both a project and a showcase. You can use everything you’ve learned—HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript—to build a website highlighting your projects and skills. <br> <br>

        Key Takeaway: <br>
        <strong>Start small. Finish something. Celebrate each project. Every completed project makes you more confident and
        prepares you for bigger challenges.</strong>
