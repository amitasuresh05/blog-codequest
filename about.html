        From building your first web app to exploring APIs, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, our content is step-by-step
        and beginner-friendly. We also cover topics like common mistakes to avoid, productivity tips, and small
        projects that you can complete to boost your confidence. <br>

        Portfolios to practice
        real skills. <br>

        helped me grow. <br>

        inspired to try things yourself. Every project, every tutorial, and every post is meant to help you gain
        confidence, improve skills, and have fun while coding.
        Whether you’re starting your first HTML page or fetching live data from an API, CodeQuest is here to guide you
        through your coding journey—step by step. <br><br>
